At Springwell, we are serious about our mission. For more than 40 years, our staff has worked to help ensure that seniors and individuals with disabilities have the village they need and the support that is necessary for them to live at home with dignity and independence.
We are also serious about our employees. We are focused on creating a supportive, open environment that values the people who make a difference - each, and every member of our staff. 
We believe in: 
Accountability: At every level of the organization we are accountable: to the people we serve, to our funders, to our employees, to community professionals who rely on our support.
Continuous Quality Improvement: We honor the fact that each of us is human, and we embrace a desire to examine the value and quality of our work and ask how we can provide a higher quality of service.
Transparency: While we don't claim to be 100% transparent (there are certain things, like salaries and performance evaluations that are private) we continuously strive to be as open as possible.
Balance: Life is a give and take, as is work. We are always examining that balance. Today, we have yoga classes on-site twice a week. We are exploring offering a Weight Watchers meeting. And afternoon meditation is under consideration. If there is a holiday to celebrate we have a party. This year, we built a dedicated lactation room for new moms. We are committed to listening to our staff, and examining and re-balancing our work environment.

ARL has animals of many types, breeds, sizes, ages, and temperaments at our adoption centers looking for permanent homes.

JPNDC undertakes an executive search for a collaborative, engaging and experienced professional to help lead this highly respected, culturally rich organization, with an eye to maintaining its successful legacy of community-driven revitalization and economic prosperity.  The new leader will be replacing long-term CEO, Richard Thal, who is retiring from the position.

About JPNDC
In 1977, in an era of urban neglect, residents of Jamaica Plain decided to take their Boston community’s future into their own hands. Forming the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation (JPNDC), they set out to create economic opportunity, replace blight with new homes and businesses, and engage people who lived here in the decisions that affected their lives. Over four decades, in response to growing demand, its geographic scope has expanded and JPNDC has evolved into one of Boston's top providers of bilingual (Spanish/English) asset-building services to low-income people of color.  

Today, the challenges have shifted due to gentrification and its cousins - the explosion of high-priced housing development and dramatically reduced economic mobility. The relentless housing crisis is not only driving the continued displacement of low-income households but shutting JPNDC out of many development opportunities. With humble, yet bold and steadfast commitment, JPNDC expanded its role in housing and economic development to two neighborhoods outside Jamaica Plain, while deepening its strategic commitment to Jamaica Plain. It also plans to foster long-term economic prosperity and wealth building, invest in community organizing as essential to building racial, economic, and social equity, and promote racial equity in all aspects of its work. 

The work is carried out in three major, equally regarded program areas: affordable housing and commercial real estate development, economic prosperity, and community organizing. Highlights of the work ahead are:
	Advancing the most ambitious housing development pipeline in JPNDC’s history, developing 550+ affordable homes that allow low-income people to thrive in Boston. 
	Redeveloping 4,000 square feet of The Brewery as a Prosperity Center, where 1,000 low-income families a year from all over Boston can overcome the odds and build long-term financial security. 
	Expanding early childhood education services to support families and help 500 low income children each year stay on track for success in school.  
	As part of Small Business Services, building JPNDC’s innovative Small Contractors Success Initiative and connecting small construction businesses owned by people of color or women to new contracts worth at least $15 million. 
	Continuing partnerships with residents of Mildred Hailey Apartments, supporting leaders and ensuring that future redevelopment meets the needs of local low-income families. 
	Building a strong leadership pipeline for JPNDC’s board and staff, with emphasis on young leaders and people of color who reflect its constituency.

The culture of JPNDC is the driving force of its success. JPNDC is grassroots and values-driven, embracing its belief in collective action, racial equity, and honoring people’s differences and diverse perspectives. JPNDC has earned the community's respect with honesty, transparency, and accountability. 

Located in the Brewery complex that JPNDC owns and operates in Jamaica Plain, JPNDC employs 33 staff across five departments who are celebrated for their expertise and their supportive and dedicated approach to the work. JPNDC’s annual operating budget is $7 million. It owns and oversees the management of 700+ permanently affordable homes in 17 different projects, as well as three commercial projects. The annual budgets of those properties total approximately $14 million. In addition, each year on average the organization is managing the development of new real estate projects with total budgets in the range of $50 million. Years of strategic and conservative fiscal decision-making combined with opportunistic and talented community development have positioned JPNDC with a solid, diverse fiscal portfolio. The 14-member Board is actively engaged as a working board, serving as thought partners and community advocates, and planners for sustainability using five committees and co-chair leadership. 

Opportunity going forward
In addition to managing JPNDC’s strong portfolio of work and a nonprofit of JPNDC’s complexity, the next CEO will be responsible for overseeing and directing the organization’s continued development in the following areas:

Developing and implementing JPNDC’s ambitious five-year strategic plan through 2023.  The plan lays out multi-year strategies of intentional growth. The COVID19 pandemic challenges the timing of the implementation plan and the ability to generate sufficient resources and will be an important responsibility of the CEO, with the Board and staff, to sort out and manage.

Carrying forward the deep traditions of community building, impact and organizing. Adherence to the grassroots tradition of listening to and engaging the community is a must. 

Deepening racial equity work.  While great credit is given to JPNDC’s work in developing its understanding and practices of racial equity, diversity and inclusion, the agency’s efforts need to continue in hiring and mentoring diverse staff leadership, building and training a board that represents the constituency, and employing equity practices in shared decision-making and professional development.

Organizing the services under a Theory of Change. Continue the integration of departments, cross-department communication and functioning by understanding the way impact is achieved throughout the whole organization and determining consistent approaches to the work.

Claiming JPNDC rich history and impact. Using all avenues of marketing, tell JPNDC’s story without compromising the collaborative nature of community and partner involvement, all to better share the impact of its work to garner further credibility, recognition, and financial support.

Overseeing an internal operations upgrade.  Delegating the details to skilled and trusted staff, oversee the building, modernizing, and automation of operational systems to free up staff and the board to be more efficient and aligned in their work. Invest in the physical office space to create an attractive, professional, and efficient work environment.

Planning for staff succession. Attend to the predicted vacancies in a senior leadership with considerable career longevity and establish a culture of mentoring, supervision, and coaching, to provide an intentional pipeline for professional growth, knowledge retention, and grooming staff of color for leadership positions. 

Qualifications:
JPNDC is seeking an experienced nonprofit leader who can champion a strong, well established organization. Ideal applicants will have:
	Working knowledge of real estate development, economic mobility strategies, and community organizing; an understanding the work of CDCs. 
	Working knowledge of real estate development, economic mobility strategies, and community organizing; an understanding of the work of CDCs.
	An established ability to be a resource broker with demonstrated experience and success with securing funding from multiple sources: corporate gifts, capital campaigns, individual giving, and grant writing.
	Demonstrated leadership in racial equity. Credible experience taking leadership in a multi-ethnic, multi-racial organization in which social, economic and racial justice and equity are imperatives. 
	Financial acumen. Aptitude for reading, analyzing, and reporting on complex finances commensurate with a $7M CDC with a significant portfolio of properties.
	Strong people skills; a relationship builder. Be diplomatic, kind, a positive problem solver, flexible, amiable, consistent, and decisive. 
	A collaborative style and proven community engagement experience in an urban setting like Jamaica Plain.
	At least seven years of increasing leadership experience, with confidence in the assessment and supervision of talented professional staff.  Demonstrated experience with organizational management and sound business practices.
	Experience being an eager public face for an organization or cause. Skilled communicator with proven writing competency. 
	An appetite for intelligent risk. Strategic agility that leverages opportunities and optimizes innovation.
	An understanding of the unique, politically lively environment inherent in the community development field, and proven ability and charisma to navigate it. 
	Experience with responding to emerging models, new technologies, and the assets of the millennial work environment.
	Bilingual (Spanish/English) speaking competency is a plus.

Application Guidelines
Candidates must include a resume and a cover letter that describes how their qualifications and experience match the needs and mission of JPNDC. Applications will be accepted until the position has been filled. Submit required document at: https://eostransitions.applicantpool.com/jobs/

Grassroots International seeks a Director of Development and Solidarity Philanthropy  to manage, expand and inspire our diverse fundraising and funder organizing program. The DDSP develops an overall fundraising strategy and coordinates implementation to meet the organization’s needs and long term sustainability, and serves on the Senior Management Team. The DDSP reports directly to the Executive Director and supervises a staff of five. This full-time position is based in Boston, MA. 

This will be a dream job for an organizer or activist with deep fundraising and leadership experience, or an experienced development professional with experience in social movements or community organizing - someone who’s passionate about justice AND fundraising, and who wants to put their skills to work in service of grassroots movements and a vision for a more just world. The ideal candidate will be highly values-aligned, eager to learn and grow, adept at building relationships with people of a wide range of identities and cultures, and a respectful and collaborative team member and manager. 

This is an exciting time to join the Grassroots International team. We’re on a dynamic trajectory of growth and learning, while remaining deeply accountable to our partners and our mission. Over the last couple of years we’ve repeatedly broken our records for fundraising from individuals and foundations. We have a strong base of loyal, longtime donors and new donor  engagement strategies are bringing in a new generation of donors. Our ED is highly involved in fundraising and the entire staff, across departments, supports a fundraising culture. The Board actively gives and engages in fundraising. 

Last year we launched a new strategic plan which renews our commitment to funding social movements through long-term partnership with those movements, and sets goals for deepening and expanding our grantmaking as well as advancing our model of Solidarity Philanthropy - decolonizing philanthropy to center those most impacted by fundamental inequities and climate change. 

The Director of Development and Solidarity Philanthropy will play an essential role in realizing our strategic plan by leading our team to secure funds from values-aligned foundations and individual donors and by providing leadership in organizing funders and donors as organizers and activists themselves. We see ourselves not just as an intermediary for institutional and individual funders, but an organizer, bridgebuilder, and leader promoting a bolder, more progressive politic in philanthropy to mobilize more resources toward global movements. The DDSP will be an integral part of that strategy. 

About Grassroots International: 

Grassroots International connects people in the US with global movements that defend land, territory, water, food, seeds and the earth. Together we address the root causes of injustice and oppression, and build alternatives that nurture human rights, ecological justice, and liberation. We do this through grantmaking, social action, and philanthropic leadership. As a public foundation, Grassroots International raises its budget annually. Our organizational culture is collaborative, relational, and deeply mission-driven.
